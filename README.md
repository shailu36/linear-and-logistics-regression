Life Expectancy project :--
Many studies have been undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy, considering demographic variables, income composition, and mortality rates. It was found that the effect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past studies, and important immunizations like Hepatitis B, Polio, and Diphtheria should also be taken into account. In this case study, we will consider immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors, and other health-related factors and use linear regression to see the effect of those factors on Life Expectancy.

Easy Visa project :-- 
In FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year.
The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. OFLC has hired the firm EasyVisa for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist at EasyVisa have to analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model:
Facilitate the process of visa approvals.
